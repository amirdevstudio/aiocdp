# PYCDP

### ** STATUS: UNDER DEVELOPMENT **

This library will provide a thin, but functional wrapper around the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

## Motivation

We aim to be the underlying engine for any libraries or projects using Chrome DevTools Protocol.
With that in mind, we need to achieve the following points:

1. Flexibility
2. Minimal external dependencies
3. Compatible with built-in python libraries

### Package

- Python `typing` module for type hints, enum literals, and other goodies
- Python `asyncio` module for async futures (Support for other async libraries is TBD)
- Python `websockets` module for websocket communication (Support for other WS libraries is TBD)

## Notes:

- The `pycdp` package will be published to PyPI
